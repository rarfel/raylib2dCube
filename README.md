# Making a litttle detour

The idea of this tangent is to build my own `DrawTriangle()` function, because I've found a bug while testing other .obj files, where sometimes faces that should be draw behind are draw on top of everything.

I tried fixing this issue but, for what i researched, theres no way except for using the 3d functions of raylib (~**unacceptable**~).

For this reason I will make my own functions, of course i will continue using raylib, but only the 2d functions.

The current state of the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/rarfel/raylib2dCube">here</a>.
